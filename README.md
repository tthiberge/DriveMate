# DriveMate
## Connecting car owners and drivers for amazing journeys!

As part of my tech bootcamp, we decided as a group to code this web app connecting:
- people who have a car but somehow cannot drive at the moment
- people who know how to drive but somehow do not have a car at the moment

The Driver will get a free trip by driving for the Owner.
The Owner, on their side, can get their car to the destination.
